# PredictingFootballGames

## Fun project to predict result of a Premier League football game using classification algorithms such as SVM or random forest.

###  Graphs have been made with plotly. They're statics in the Notebook.

> Make sure to install and import all requirements. Treemap must have issue since a special version of plotly is required.
